    <p>
      At my age I feel like I've seen and done it all, so you can only imagine
      my shock at finding a new way to do eggs. I would never have thought to
      pair yogurt with poached eggs and a spicy red pepper butter, but it might
      be my new favorite breakfast now. Fried eggs also work in this, any way
      you like 'em. Serve with toasted crusty bread for dipping.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup Greek yogurt, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or to taste (Optional)</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>2 ½ tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Spoon yogurt into a medium bowl. Grate in garlic and mix to combine.
        Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne. Add dill and mix thoroughly. Set
        aside at room temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; heat until bubbles begin to
        burst. Add cumin, paprika, and chili flakes. Stir until color is
        uniform, then turn off heat and let spices infuse.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grind parsley and jalapeno together in a mortar. Season with salt,
        drizzle in olive oil, and stir to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fill a large saucepan with 2 to 3 inches of water and bring to a boil.
        Reduce heat to medium-low, pour in vinegar, and keep the water at a
        gentle simmer. Crack an egg into a small bowl then gently slip egg into
        the simmering water, holding the bowl just above the surface of water.
        Repeat with the remaining eggs. Cook eggs until the whites are firm and
        the yolks have thickened but are not hard, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Remove
        the eggs from the water with a slotted spoon, dab on a kitchen towel to
        remove excess water, and place onto a warm plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dollop yogurt mixture onto serving plates. Use the back of a spoon to
        spread yogurt out into a bed for the eggs, carving ridges into the top
        to catch the oil. Drizzle on some jalapeno oil. Top with eggs and a
        spoonful or two of the Aleppo butter. Sprinkle sea salt on top.
